    "### Business Understanding\n",
    "In the competitive airline industry, customer satisfaction is paramount. Understanding customer feedback is crucial for service improvement and operational efficiency. This project aims to analyze customer feedback to gain insights into their experiences and sentiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals of the Analysis\n",
    "The primary goals of this analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: To automatically determine if a customer's comment is negative (complaint), positive (compliment), or neutral (opinion). This will enable us to gauge overall customer sentiment towards the airline services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback Categorization**: To classify customer feedback into categories relevant to different departments within the airline. This will help in routing the feedback to the appropriate department for further action. For example:\n",
    "  - **Luggage Issues**: Feedback about damaged or lost luggage will be directed to the Luggage Department.\n",
    "  - **Flight Delays and Operations**: Complaints regarding delayed flights or operational issues will be sent to Customer Service or Operations Department.\n",
    "  - **Financial Concerns**: Issues related to overcharges, refunds, or billing will be directed to the Finance Department.\n",
    "\n",
    "By automating the process of sentiment analysis and categorization, the airline can respond to customer feedback more effectively and ensure that the right issues are addressed by the appropriate departments promptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "The successful completion of this project will provide the airline with a tool that:\n",
    "- Assesses customer sentiment in real-time.\n",
    "- Categorizes feedback for operational efficiency.\n",
    "- Identifies key areas for service improvement.\n",
    "- Enhances the overall customer experience through targeted action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "With the problem defined, the next steps involve collecting and preparing the data for analysis, which will be covered in the following sections of this notebook."
